      [1m1.0  Introduction to the Generalized Markup Language     [0m

       The practice of generalized markup of source documents has significant
       benefits not only for SCRIPT/VS processing, but also facilitates many
       other applications.



        [1m1.1  What is Generalized Markup?  [0m

         To mark up a source document is to add information to it that enables a
         person or system to process it in some way. The added information or
         markup can be instructions called control words, or indicators, or
         descriptions of some kind. Document markup is the primary means of
         instructing a computerizes text processing system, such as SCRIPT/VS,
         how a document is to be processed.

         A document can be marked up in two ways:

         1. With specific markup, which limits text processing to a particular
            application.

         2. With generalized markup, which describes the contents x{Õ the
            parts of the document.[1m{1}[0m

         A GML tage identifies the associated text as a particular document
         elemeny. For example:

         .  A book might have the major divisions:

            .  front matter

            .  body

            .  back matter

            Within those divisions we can have paragraphs, examples, figures,
            list items, and so on.

         .  A memo might have document elements of addressee, date, sender,
            address, subject, and reference, as well as other types similar to
            those of a book.

         You might ask, "Why use generalized markup instead of specific markup"?
         Well, thinking in terms of the content or purpose of the parts of a
         document is easier than thinking in terms of how the parts should be
         processed or how they should appear when printed. A person doing
         generalized markup can concentrate on the text, without thinking about
         the format.

 -----------------

         [1m{1}[0m A starter set of GML tags is provided with the Document Composition
         Facility to allow the user to get going.

                                Company Confidential

         There are benefits of generalized markup when your only application will
         be text processing with SCRIPT/VS and others when you anticipate
         additional applications.

         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------




         I've just drawn a little figure here
         where I've left 10 picas and 6 points of
         space before the text of the figure
         started. I've set my width to four
         inches -- if I print out my
         document with a column width of
         four inches or larger, my figure
         will be column width, if I print
         out my document with a column width
         of less than four inches, my figure
         will extend the width of the page
         dimension.

             [1mFigure 1.  A Sample Figure:  [0mThis figure also gives you a little
           bit of information on how the WIDTH attribute of the FIG tag works.



          [1m1.1.1  Potential Benefits of GML for SCRIPT/VS Text Processing  [0m

           Here are some potential benefits in using GML when you intend to use
           SCRIPT/VS only for text processing:

           .  Alternative GML interpretation. A GML tag need not be limited to a
              single SCRIPT/VS interpretation. For example, a tag might indicate
              that a group of words in the text is a title. For one application,
              you might want titles to be enclosed in quotation marks. But for
              another application, you might want titles to be underlined or set
              in italics. Each application could be satisfied by alternative GML
              interpretations, [4mwith no change[0m[0m to the source document or to the
              markup of titles. As described in a later section in this chapter,
              you have control over the way GML is interpreted.

           .  Ease of markup It is easy to remember GML tags because they can
              consist of terms and abbreviations commonly used to descibe a
              document. GML generally requires fewer characters to be entered for
              markup than a corresponding complex sequence of control words. The
              result is faster markup and keying of the document. Changes to the
              markup are also faster and may even be eliminated with GML, because
              you can control how GML is interpreted.

           .  Ease of Text update. It's easy to update text marked up with GML.
              With GML, such things as the numbering of items in a numbered list
              is left to the formatter, which numbers the items automatically.

              Thus, when you insert or delete an item, you don`t have to renumber
              subsequent items, as you would have to if the numbers were part of
              the source text.

      This program has three major functions :-

      1. To create/modify the list of graphs associated with a particular
         Experiment Identity.

      2. To create/modify the list of graphs associated with a particular Engine
         Type and User Key.

      3. To import graphs from the Mainframe R280 Database onto the Experiment
         Analyser (EA) Database. This may be done either one graph at a time, or
         several graphs at a time by specifying a Graph Identifier Table (GIDT).

      [1mSpace Usage of R280 Books[0m

      When an R280 verse is read from the Mainframe onto a Workstation, a file is
      created in the '.r280/<r280 book>' directory in the user's home directory.

      These R280 verses are used to speed up Mainframe access as they are read in
      preference to those on the Mainframe if the Mainframe R280 verse has not
      been modified since the last read.

      A number of problems occur due to this system :-

      .  The R280 verses are never deleted from the Workstation and so use up
         precious file server space.

      .  An R280 verse can be available on the Workstation when it has been
         deleted from the Mainframe.

      .  The files are hidden from the user (stored in a directory stating with
         the dot character) and the actual file names give little indication of
         the data held within.

      I would recommend that a program is run every weekend which deletes any
      R280 verses which have not been used for some period of time (say 8 weeks)
      or have been deleted from the mainframe.

      [1mUSE OF PRODUCTION G404 VER 2D8[0m

      To produce an acceptable MERGE facility in G404 a number of outstanding
      bugs in the program have been fixed and a number of options have been
      altered.

      A list of the bugs & alterations are given on the release sheet for this
      version.

      The purpose of this note is to make the users aware of the alterations to
      the options and indicate how to use them.




      The options that have been changed are described below.

      [1mPLOT(PL)[0m[0m

      Only the appearance of the plot has been changed. This has been necessary
      to highlight the differences between the three possible sections (inlet,
      engine and bypass) which make up an annulus and to distinguish between the
      current and background annuli when two are present.

      The modifications to the display are as follows

      .  Each section of the annulus uses a separate symbol to display the
         stations contained within it.

      .  If two annuli are present then the background annulus uses a separate
         set of symbols for its stations and the outer annulus wall (if
         displayed) uses a dashed line instead of a solid line.

      .  A key to the symbols used is displayed on the screen.

      See Figure 1 for an example plot.

      [1mCREATE(CR)[0m[0m

      The current production create option has a number of hidden options and
      makes a few assumptions about the layout of the annulus from the way the
      user enters the stations.





     Gle/CW (CW#D0001)

      The hidden prompts are

      [1mID    [0mTo prompt the user for the type and identification of the station
            being entered.

      [1mENG   [0mTo define the station being entered as the first station in the
            engine section.

      In many cases users do not use these options correctly e.g. often defining
      an engine section without using the ENG prompt causing the program to
      assume an inlet section definition.

      All stations in the inlet and engine section have to be added monotonically
      and any non-monotonic stations are added as the first station in the bypass
      section (if an engine section had already been defined).

      This option thus causes a number of problems which are directly relevant to
      the correct operation of the merge option i.e. it is not possible to define
      a bypass section or an inlet section with a bypass section.

      This restriction in the types of annuli that can be created prevents users
      from working with partial annulus definitions which are to be merged
      together later on in the design procedure.




      A new create option has been written to overcome the problems in using the
      previous create command.

      The user is required to enter the section for each station to be added.
      This allows a non-monotonic input of sections and the ability to define an
      annulus consisting of any combination of inlet, engine or bypass sections.

      [1mNote: [0mIn cross-hair input the prompting mechanism for the section works
            differently.

      The commands are still the same i.e.

      [1mINLET(IN)           [0mTo define the station as an Inlet Section station.

      [1mENGINE(ENG)         [0mTo define the station as an Engine Section station.

      [1mBYPASS(BYP)         [0mTo define the station as an Bypass Section station.

      [1mEND(E)              [0mTo end the CREATE command.

      Unfortunately the user can only enter a single character at the cross-hairs
      which means that for commands longer than one character the '+' character
      must be entered to put up a prompt from which longer commands can be
      entered.




     Gle/CW (CW#D0001)
     22 August 1988
     - 3 -


      Entering RETURN at the cross-hairs takes the default section which is
      initially the engine section but from then on defaults to the last defined
      section.

      The ID command has been removed from this option to avoid too many prompts
      occuring in the text area causing continual screen erasures and subsequent
      re-plotting. This is not considered a major omission as this facility is
      available using the IDENT(ID) option.




      [1mADD(A)[0m[0m

      This has the same format as the CREATE command.

      The command only allows one station to be added at a time and cannot be
      used to add the first station of an annulus.




      [1mIDENT(ID)[0m[0m

      This option now prompts for the information required.

      The option also contains three extra commands at the top level which allow
      the user to change any station in a single Inlet, Engine or Bypass section
      to be a Inlet station or the first station in an Engine or Bypass section.




      [1mMERGE(M)[0m[0m

      This option requires no input by the user but will only merge certain
      combinations of annuli.

      The numbers refered to below refer to the seven possible annulus
      combinations as illustrated in Figure 2.

      The possible merge combinations are (assuming no overlap) shown below with
      the first number being the Leftmost Annulus and the second number(s) the
      Rightmost Annulus

         1 to 5,6,7
